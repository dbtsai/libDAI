SCIENTISTS: please be aware that the fact that this program is released as Free
Software does not excuse you from scientific propriety, which obligates you to
give appropriate credit! If you write a scientific paper describing research
that made substantive use of this program, it is your moral obligation as a
scientist to (a) mention the fashion in which this software was used, including
the version number, with a citation to the literature, to allow replication;
(b) mention this software in the Acknowledgements section.  The appropriate
citation is:

Approximate Inference methods", http://mloss.org/software/view/77/.

Moreover, as a personal note, I would appreciate it if you would email me with
citations of papers referencing this work so I can mention them to my funding
agent and tenure committee.


About libDAI
------------
libDAI is a free/open source C++ library (licensed under GPL) that provides
implementations of various (approximate) inference methods for discrete
graphical models. libDAI supports arbitrary factor graphs with discrete
variables; this includes discrete Markov Random Fields and Bayesian Networks.

The library is targeted at researchers; to be able to use the library, a good
understanding of graphical models is needed.


Limitations
-----------
libDAI is not intended to be a complete package for approximate inference.
Instead, it should be considered as an "inference engine", providing various
inference methods. In particular, it contains no GUI, currently only supports
its own file format for input and output (although support for standard file
formats may be added later), and provides very limited visualization
functionalities.


Features
--------
Currently, libDAI supports the following (approximate) inference methods:

    * Exact inference by brute force enumeration;
    * Exact inference by junction-tree methods;
    * Mean Field;
    * Loopy Belief Propagation [KFL01];
    * Tree Expectation Propagation [MiQ04];
    * Generalized Belief Propagation [YFW05];
    * Double-loop GBP [HAK03];
    * Various variants of Loop Corrected Belief Propagation [MoK07, MoR05].


Why C++?
--------
Because libDAI is implemented in C++, it is very fast compared with
implementations in MatLab (a factor 1000 faster is not uncommon). libDAI does
provide a MatLab interface for easy integration with MatLab.


Releases
--------

License: GNU Public License v2 (or higher).

Acknowledgments
---------------
This work is part of the Interactive Collaborative Information Systems (ICIS) 
project, supported by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, grant BSIK03024. 
I would like to thank Martijn Leisink for providing the basis on which libDAI has been built.


Documentation
-------------
Some doxygen documentation is available. Install doxygen and use "make doc" to build the
documentation. If the documentation is not clear enough, feel free to send me an email 
(or even better, to improve the documentation!).

A description of the factor graph (.fg) file format can be found in the file FILEFORMAT.


Compatibility
-------------
The code has been developed under Debian GNU/Linux with the GCC compiler suite.
libDAI compiles successfully with g++ versions 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3.

libDAI has also been successfully compiled with MS Visual Studio 2008 under Windows
(but not all build targets are supported yet).


Quick start (linux/cygwin)
--------------------------
You need:
- a recent version of gcc (at least version 3.4)
- GNU make
- doxygen
- graphviz
- recent boost C++ libraries (at least version 1.34)

On Debian/Ubuntu, you can easily install all these packages with a single command:
"apt-get install g++ make doxygen libboost-dev libboost-graph-dev libboost-program-options-dev"
(root permissions needed).

To build the source, edit the Makefile and adapt it to your local setup. Then, run
    
    make

If the build was successful, you can test the example program:

    ./example tests/alarm.fg

or the more elaborate test program:

    tests/testdai --aliases tests/aliases.conf --filename tests/alarm.fg --methods JTREE_HUGIN BP_SEQMAX


Quick start (windows)
---------------------
You need:
- A recent version of MicroSoft Visual Studio (2008 works)
- recent boost C++ libraries (version 1.34 or higher)

To build the source, edit the Makefile and adapt it to your local setup. Then, run (from the command line)
    
    nmake -f Makefile.win

If the build was successful, you can test the example program:

    example tests\alarm.fg

or the more elaborate test program:

    tests\testdai --aliases tests\aliases.conf --filename tests\alarm.fg --methods JTREE_HUGIN BP_SEQMAX
